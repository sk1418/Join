INTRODUCTION                                                *Join-intro*

|Join| provides more powerful line join features than the build-in |:join|. 

Features:

Except for all features provided by the build-in |:join| command, |Join| can: 

    - |Join| lines with separator (any string)
    - |Join| lines with or without trimming the leading whitespaces
    - |Join| lines with negative count (backwards join)
    - |Join| lines in reverse
    - |Join| lines and keep joined lines (without removing)
    - |Join| lines with any combinations of above options

==============================================================================
USAGE                                               *:J* *:Join* *Join-usage*

This plugin has defined only one command: |:Join||. If there is no other
customer command (by other plugins maybe) starting with "J", |:J| is also
available for |:Join|. 

The command format is:

:[range]Join[!] [separator] [count] [flags]
		
Arguments description:
    
    - [range] follows the rule of |cmdline-ranges|
    - [!](bang) if with "!" all leading and trailing whitespaces of joined
    lines will be kept
    - [count] Join [count] lines starting with [range]. If [count] is negative
    number, join [count] lines backwards. Check |Join-range-count| or
    |Join-negative-count|
    - [flags] Two flags are available: 
        r : (reverse) join lines in reverse
        k : (keep) don't remove joined line after join

Argument rules:

    - Arguments should be separated by space
    - If [separator] occurence, it must be the first argument also must be
    quoted by '(single quote) or "(double quote)
    - The order of [count] and [flags] is free. For example the following two
    commands have exactly same meaning: >
      :J 5 kr
      :J kr 5
<      
    - all arguments are optional. If an argument was not given by user, the default
    value will be used:
>
        ========================
        arg      | Default value
        ========================
        range    | current line 
        count    | 1            
        !(bang)  | ""           
        separator| " "          
        flags    | ""           
        ------------------------
<
                                        *Join-negative-count* *Join-range-count*

If [count] is negative. |Join| will join lines backwards. For example:

before: >

    aa
    bb
    cc
    dd* (* indicates cursor)
    ee

After executing command >
  :J -3

    aa
    bb cc dd
    ee*

If [range] is crossing multiple lines, with [count] together, |Join| will do in
this way:

    if [count] > 0, the largest line number in [range] will be the base, and join
    [count] lines

    if [count] < 0, the smallest line number in [range] will be the base, and
    join abs([count]) lines backwards

check |Join-examples| for detail.
